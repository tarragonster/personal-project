# How to be competent in programming

## Problem 1:
#### Context:
- Learn new language or concept, reading document or code is compulsory
#### Issue:
- Is would take too much time to learn from document and code
#### Why should you care?:
- Can save load of time and effort
- Time for pleasure
#### Solution:
- The target must be clear:
  + Understand the concept
  + Understand the fundamental
  
- To understand concept -> should not concern with detail, focus on
the general idea, READ DOCUMENT (what is it about, problem it solves, reason of existence,
situation it can be useful, understand the reference)

- To understand the fundamental
  + Library -> read the codebase / rewrite parts to grab the idea
  + Language -> do simple code demo and check the code example
  + Try the implementation interface

## Problem 2:
#### Context:
- In the fast changing environment, fast personal growth is crucial
#### Issue:
- It takes time to grow effectively
#### Why should you care?:
- More opportunity
- Efficiency would save lots of personal time
