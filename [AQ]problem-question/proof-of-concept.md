#Proof of concept

###1. What is Proof of Concept?

- A PoC is an approach that allows business to validate the feasibility of new ideas.
- A PoC can take the form of a working part of the final product, developed with specific technology, 
  to prove that the software can solve a particular business problem.
- A PoC is not a simplified version of the product with minimal features. 
  It’s a standalone project that validates a product idea.
- A negative result from a proof of concept saves a lot of time and development costs.
- If the result is positive, the team can be certain that they have the right technology and that it’s feasible to build the complete product.
- Methods of testing key hypotheses and validating fundamental assumptions about target users and the software concept.

###2. Why should you initiate a PoC project?

- Save resources by minimizing development costs.
- Stay competitive and develop unique products.
- Fund the project – the data gathered from a POC can help attract investors and initial investment.
- Verify if your product idea is feasible or not.
- Unveil risks and bugs that occur at an early stage of development.
- Accelerate the release or time-to-market by identifying risks and preparing mitigation measures.
- Help the team better understand how your product works.

###3. Do an analysis on options, solutions or ideas on aspects

- Feasible -> possible
- Viable -> workable
- Applicable -> relevant
- Practical -> resources (people to maintain, application, infrastructure)

###4. Step to create a PoC

- Prove the need (How is it really needed, is it required by the market, how does it really solve the problem?)
- Problem solution mapping (map the main point of solution to the problem, 
  being specific, how this will map to the problem, solution will have answers to problem)
- Prototyping (finalizing solutions/platform/tool -> prototype how u do that 
  (sample user scenario and actual user scenario,
  automate scenario with the solution you are proposing,
  highlight-showcase this solution can take care of all the problems,
  show prototype to stakeholder -> questions/answer/feedback)
- Create MVP (Minimum Viable Product) having most essential feature of the product
  release it for small group of people to actually use it
- Learning & roadmap (improvement and changes -> clarity) noting and document what you have learnt & roadmap
