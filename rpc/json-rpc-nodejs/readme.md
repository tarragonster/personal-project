# JSON-RPC Nodejs

## Questions

1. What is JSON-RPC?

RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call and is a protocol that one 
program can use to request a service from a program located in 
another computer on a network without having to understand the 
networkâ€™s details. RPC uses the client-server model. The requesting
program is a client and the service providing program is the 
server. Like a regular or local procedure call, an RPC is a 
synchronous operation requiring the requesting program to be 
suspended until the results of the remote procedure are returned
