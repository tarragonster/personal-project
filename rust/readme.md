# Rust

rustup update stable
```

### 2. Cargo cli-command

```shell
cargo build
cargo run
cargo test <fuc_name>
```

### 3. Composition

1. What is composite pattern
    - Partitioning design pattern
    - A group of objects that are treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object
    - The intent of a composite is to "compose" objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies
    - Ref: Christian Ivicevic [28 Days of Rust â€” Part 2: Composition over Inheritance](https://medium.com/comsystoreply/28-days-of-rust-part-2-composition-over-inheritance-cab1b106534a) \

2. From and Into
   - Implementation of `Into<B>` for A for every `From<A>` for B. Said implementation exposes an `A::into()` method that automatically calls `B::from()` that we implement ourselves.
   - Ref: [From and Into](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/conversion/from_into.html) \
