# Hashring - Consistent Hashing

In computer science, consistent hashing[1][2] is a special kind of hashing technique such that when a hash table is resized, only {\displaystyle n/m}n/m keys need to be remapped on average where {\displaystyle n}n is the number of keys and {\displaystyle m}m is the number of slots
