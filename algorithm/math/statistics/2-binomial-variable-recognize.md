# Binomial variables

### Note

#### Practices

1. A manager oversees 11 female employees and 9 male employees. They need to
pick 3 of these employees to go on business trip so the manager places all 20
in a hat and chooses at random. let X = number of female chosen
    - The trials are not independent, so X is not binomial

2. In a game of luck, a turn consists of a player continuing to roll a pair
of six dire until they roll double (two of the same face values). Let X
= number of rolls in one turn
    - The number of trials is not fixed cuz continuous rolls till double
