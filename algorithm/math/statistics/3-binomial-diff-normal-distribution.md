# Difference between binomial distribution and normal distribution

### Explanation
1. The main difference between the binomial and normal distributions 
is that the binomial distribution is a discrete distribution whereas 
the normal distribution is a continuous distribution.

- This means that a binomial random variable can only take integer 
values such as 1, 2, 3, etc. whereas the normal variable can take 
any real number value such as 1.2 or 2.314, etc.

2. The second difference between them is that a binomial random 
variable has a finite range whereas the normal distribution has 
an infinite range

3. The binomial distribution is limited in its applications. 
It is only used in situations where a trial can have only two 
possible outcomes – success or failure. For example, when tossing 
a coin many times we use the binomial distribution to calculate 
probabilities (since tossing a coin has only two outcomes – heads 
or tails).

- On the other hand, the normal distribution finds many applications 
in real-life situations such as modelling the height or weight distribution 
of a population. The normal distribution can in fact be used to calculate 
probabilities for binomial distribution using the method of the normal 
approximation to binomial.
