# Algorithm

### Time Space Complexity (Big O)

1. What is Big O notation?
- the efficiency of your algorithm

2. 2 type of big 0?
- Time complexity -> performance (efficiency & fast)
- Space complexity -> memory usage (extra variable & data structure)

3. Big-0 complexity ranking
- O(1) - constant -> good
- O(log n) - logarithmic -> good
- O(n) - linear -> fair
- O(n log n) - linear * log -> bad
- O(n * n) - quadratic -> horrible
- O(2 ^ n) - exponential -> horrible
- O(n!) - factorial -> max horrible

4. Range of efficiency
- best - average - worst
- Big-o normally addressed with the worst case scenarios

### Common questions

1. What is algorithm and what problem does it solve?
- An algorithm is a defined set of step-by-step procedures that 
provides the correct answer to a particular problem

1. What is potential pitfalls when using Algorithms?
- this process tends to be very time-consuming
- if you face a situation where a decision needs to be made very quickly, 
you might be better off using a different problem-solving strategy
